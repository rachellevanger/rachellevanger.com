I like to collect images and quotes that are math and/or art related on [MATH:INTERSECTS:ART](http://mathintersectsart.tumblr.com/).

I maintain the [@MathArtNYC](https://twitter.com/MathArtNYC) Twitter account so you can see what’s going on around the city that’s falls in the intersection of math and art.
