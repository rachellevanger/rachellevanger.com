       <p>Hi, I'm Rachel.</p>

       <p>I love finding patterns in large datasets and enjoy helping others do the same.</p> 

       <p>I am currently the Director of Data Science for <a href="http://www.fnf.com">Fidelity National Financial</a>, where I am helping to build a culture of data-driven insight and innovation.</p>

       <p>I originally got my start in 2001 as an operations processor in the <a href="https://www.wellsfargofunds.com/ind/account-services/account-inactivity.html">unclaimed property</a> department at <a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">Wells Fargo Bank</a>, where I learned business process, database, and in-house software design from the ground up. From there, I took my skills as a business analyst to the next level at <a href="http://www.fnf.com/">Fidelity National Financial</a>, where I focused primarily on large software integrations spanning operations, accounting, and reporting systems. I left the corporate world in 2012 to pursue a PhD in mathematics, which I earned in May 2017 from <a href="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a>. Following my graduate studies, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where my research, funded primarily by <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/models-dynamics-and-learning">DARPA's MoDyL program</a>, focused primarily on topological methods for high-dimensional data analysis with a specialization in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology">persistent homology</a>.</p>

       <p>As always: looking forward to the next big adventure!</p>
