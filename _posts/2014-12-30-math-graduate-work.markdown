I am a fourth year PhD student in the <a href="http://http://math.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">mathematics department at Rutgers University</a>, where I work under the direction of <a href="http://math.rutgers.edu/~mischaik/" target="_blank">Dr. Konstantin Mischaikow</a>. My research interests lie in the intersection of topological data analysis (TDA) and machine learning. More specifically, I study persistent homology and its applications to time series of 2D and 3D images.

In August 2015 I spoke at the <a href="http://rybu.org/appliedtopmeeting" target="_blank">Applied Topology and High-Dimensional Data Analysis</a> meeting in Victoria, BC. The slides for my talks can be found here:

<strong><a href="docs/Application_of_Persistent_Homology_web.pdf">Using Persistent Homology to study dynamics in the space of persistence diagrams, Part I
</a></strong>
<blockquote>ABSTRACT: It is common practice to study dynamical systems on domains with periodic boundary conditions to remove boundary effects imposed by a domain of finite size. While this solves one problem, it potentially creates another: two solutions that are symmetry-related may be seen as separate solutions to the system. While there are classical methods to determine if two solutions are symmetry-related, we show how persistent homology is a natural tool that can be used to quotient out these symmetries. Meant to be an introduction to persistent homology and applied topology, we assume no background in fluid dynamics, and only minimal familiarity with dynamical systems. Rather, this talk is meant to familiarize the audience with two flavors of applications of persistent homology--reducing a scalar field to a persistence diagram and analyzing the shape of a point cloud--,and to see how these two methods work together to say something about the dynamics of a time-evolving system.</blockquote>

<strong><a href="docs/ATHDDA_Levanger_Part_II.pdf">Using Persistent Homology to study dynamics in the space of persistence diagrams, Part II</a></strong>
<blockquote>ABSTRACT: Building on the concepts from my talk in Part I, we address more nuanced issues that occur when studying the dynamics of fluid flows. This includes addressing sampling rates for periodic orbits and techniques for analyzing large point clouds. We also explore the use of diffusion map projections and show how this approach can help to organize and correlate the data to natural measurements of the system.
