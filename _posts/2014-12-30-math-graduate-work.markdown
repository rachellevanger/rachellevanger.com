I am a fourth year PhD student in the <a href="http://http://math.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">mathematics department at Rutgers University</a>, where I work under the direction of <a href="http://math.rutgers.edu/~mischaik/" target="_blank">Dr. Konstantin Mischaikow</a> on both theoretical and applied aspects of persistent homology.

**Identifying defects in 2D experimental and simulated convection flows**

My latest project uses ideas from discrete morse theory and persistent homology to identify defect patterns in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection. The following video was made from experimental data taken at the [Mike Schatz laboratory](http://www.schatzlab.gatech.edu/). Highlighted regions in the persistence diagrams indicate parameters for simple pattern-matching algorithms based on the output of the [diamorse](https://github.com/AppliedMathematicsANU/diamorse) application, which computes persistence using ideas from discrete Morse theory, providing a geometric link between the persistence points and the source images.

**Publications**

Here are <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Levanger_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">some papers on arXiv.org</a> that I had a part in writing.
