I am a fifth year PhD student in the <a href="http://math.rutgers.edu/" target="_blank">mathematics department at Rutgers University</a>, where I work under the direction of <a href="http://math.rutgers.edu/~mischaik/" target="_blank">Dr. Konstantin Mischaikow</a> on both theoretical and applied aspects of persistent homology. Please download my [cv](cv.pdf) and [research statement](research_statement.pdf). Here are descriptions of some of my recent projects:

**Interactive visualization tool for the persistence diagrams of digital images**

Ever wonder how the points in your persistence diagram correspond to the features in the digital images you're processing? Download the [tda-d3-explorer](https://github.com/rachellevanger/tda-d3-explorer) app from GitHub and explore your data! Based on the persistence computations from [PHAT](https://github.com/blazs/phat) that utilize discrete Morse theory, this software enables you to encircle persistence points of interest and will then display the corresponding critical cell pairings overlaid on your image, as the screen shot below shows. It also includes a reverse search feature: select a region of interest on the image and the tool will highlight any persistence points with critical cells from their underlying pairings that fall inside.

The tool is also great for studying time series of persistence diagrams generated from digital images. The software includes an installation script that will locally install a copy of PHAT and other required dependencies. It also includes [a Jupyter notebook that will get you started on some test data](https://github.com/rachellevanger/tda-d3-explorer/blob/master/doc/Tutorial.ipynb). The test images are numerical simulations of Rayleigh-Benard convection flow and were generously provided by the [Paul Research Group](http://www.me.vt.edu/mpaul/) at Virginia Tech.


**Identifying defects in 2D experimental and simulated convection flows**

One of my latest projects uses ideas from discrete morse theory and persistent homology to identify defect patterns in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection. The following video was made from simulated data from the [Paul Research Group](http://www.me.vt.edu/mpaul/) at Virginia Tech (experimental data taken at the [Mike Schatz laboratory](http://www.schatzlab.gatech.edu/)). Highlighted regions in the persistence diagrams indicate parameters for pattern-matching algorithms based on the output of an [application](https://github.com/rachellevanger/image-tda-rayleigh-benard-convection) I've been working on.

<!-- **Web tool for exploring time series of persistence diagrams generated by 2D-video**

As part of the above research project, I've developed a simple web tool using D3 that enables researchers to interact with their data more efficiently.

**Towards numerical analysis with persistence diagrams**

This is my primary theoretical result. Using the induced matchin theorem and the generalized notion of interleavings of persistence modules, it was possible to construct a local notion of errors. This gives tighter bounds for rigorous computations that utilize persistence diagrams.

**Publications and other work**

Here are <a href="http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Levanger_R/0/1/0/all/0/1">some papers on arXiv.org</a> that I had a part in writing. I maintain my [active projects on github](http://github.com/rachellevanger).
