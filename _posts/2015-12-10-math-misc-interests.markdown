<strong><a href="docs/MathematicsAsMetaphor.pdf" target="_blank">Mathematics as Metaphor: Mathematics in Contemporary Art.</a></strong>
A paper I wrote for a course in Contemporary Art, Fall 2010, under the instruction of <a href="http://www.unf.edu/coas/art-design/faculty/Heuer.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Elizabeth Heuer</a> at the University of North Florida.
<blockquote><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong>  By examining the relationship between mathematics and art from a historical standpoint, and then looking at the works of Bruce Nauman and specifically his works that use the mathematical subject of topology as motivation, we will see a way in which mathematics may be used to inform contemporary art by way of artistic process and not merely through illustration.</blockquote>

<strong><a href="docs/DuelingScribbles.jar" target="_blank">Dueling Scribbles.</a></strong>  A small JAVA program that randomly generates two "scribbles" according to a mathematical set of rules (press "d" repeatedly to redraw the scribbles), and the beginnings of an art project on computer generated art and identity.  What surprised me in this project was that <em>the nature of the scribbles, though random, seemed to betray the non-randomness of the random number generator used to create them</em>. When drawn, sometimes both will be clumped up in a corner, or both will be splayed out across the page, even though each scribble is instantiated entirely separately from the other.

Dear    
math,   
fractals,    
spiraling    
language of nature,    
help me see the world through new eyes.
