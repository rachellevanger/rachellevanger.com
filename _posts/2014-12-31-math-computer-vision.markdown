One of my latest projects uses ideas from discrete morse theory and persistent homology to identify defect patterns in Rayleigh-BÃ©nard convection. The following video was made from simulated data from the [Paul Research Group](http://www.me.vt.edu/mpaul/) at Virginia Tech (experimental data taken at the [Mike Schatz laboratory](http://www.schatzlab.gatech.edu/)). Highlighted regions in the persistence diagrams indicate parameters for pattern-matching algorithms based on the output of an [application](https://github.com/rachellevanger/image-tda-rayleigh-benard-convection) I've been working on.
