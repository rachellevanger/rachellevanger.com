I was involved in a research project concerning inequalities of singular values of positive semi-definite matrices under the direction of <a href="http://www.unf.edu/coas/math-stat/faculty/Dr__Raluca_Dumitru.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Raluca Dumitru</a> at the University of North Florida during the Fall 2011 term.  We were able to reduce the inequality in question and our <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379513004655">results were published</a> in Linear Algebra and its Applications.

<strong><a href="docs/BT_Animated_Presentation_Web.pdf" target="_blank">PRESENTATION: Imagining the Banach-Tarski Paradox.</a></strong> Presented at the Pi Mu Epsilon National Meeting at MathFest 2011, in Lexington, KY, on August 4, 2011 and received a <a href="http://www.pme-math.org/conferences/national/2011/awards2011.html" target="_blank">student speaker award</a>.
<blockquote><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> The Banach-Tarski Paradox states that it is possible to take a solid ball in three-dimensional space, divide it into a finite number of non-overlapping subsets, and then recombine those sets to create two balls with the original size and volume of the first, thus duplicating the sphere. In this presentation, we will examine the precise formulation of duplicative paradoxes, and then follow the development of the Banach-Tarski Paradox from the hollow sphere to the solid ball. With the use of <strong>Mathematica</strong><strong> pictures and animations</strong> throughout the presentation, we will provide a <strong>visual interpretation</strong> of how such a decomposition is possible, aiding in developing an intuition for the sets involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An expository writing concerning the development of the Banach-Tarski Paradox, aimed at the advanced undergraduate level.  Served as an introduction to <strong>LaTeX</strong> and <strong>Mathematica</strong>.  Work performed under the direction of <a href="http://www.unf.edu/coas/math-stat/faculty/Dr__Scott_Hochwald.aspx" target="_blank">Dr. Scott Hochwald</a> at the University of North Florida, Spring 2011.</blockquote>
